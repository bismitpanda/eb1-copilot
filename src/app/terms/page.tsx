                  YOU AND GC AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL
                  TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND
                  CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AND GC ARE AGREEING
                  TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The

                  govern if twenty-five (25) or more similar or coordinated

                  coordinated counsel, may not consolidate more than one
                  individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or
                  representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding
                  involving more than one individual.

                  For any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the consumer
                  filing fee, and GC will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs.
                  For any arbitration initiated by GC, GC will pay all AAA fees
                  and costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For all arbitrations where the claims asserted are $25,000 or
                  less, the arbitration shall be resolved according to the AAA’s
                  Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document
                  Submission, and for all other arbitrations the following
                  procedure will apply: (a) the arbitrator will conduct
                  hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference rather
                  than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines
                  upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is
                  appropriate; (b) any in-person appearances will be held at a
                  location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with
                  due consideration of their ability to travel and other
                  pertinent circumstances; and (c) if the parties are unable to
                  agree on a location, such determination should be made by the
                  AAA or by the arbitrator.

                  If you or GC submits a dispute to arbitration and the
                  arbitrator orders any exchange of information, you and GC
                  agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for
                  any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise
                  sensitive information, documents, testimony, and/or other
                  materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery
                  in the arbitration. You and GC agree to seek such protection
                  before any such information, documents, testimony, and/or
                  materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of
                  discovery in the arbitration.

                  The arbitrator’s decision will follow these Terms and will be
                  final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
                  temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief
                  providing for specific performance of these Terms but only to
                  the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
                  individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by
                  the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court
                  having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the
                  foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from
                  bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
                  agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against

                  GC or against you by the same or coordinated counsel or are
                  otherwise coordinated. In addition to the application of the
                  AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA
                  Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule, you and GC

                  similar claims are asserted against GC or you by the same or
                  coordinated counsel or are otherwise resolved, your or GC’s
                  Arbitrable Claim might be delayed. For such coordinated
                  actions, you and GC also agree to the following coordinated
                  bellwether process. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for
                  GC shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed
                  first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a
                  bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or
                  deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed
                  in connection with those cases until they are selected to
                  proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a
                  bellwether process. If the parties are unable to resolve the
                  remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty
                  (20) proceedings, each side shall select another ten (10)
                  cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration
                  proceedings as part of a second bellwether process. The
                  remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in
                  arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection
                  with those cases until they are selected to proceed to
                  individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether
                  process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each case.
                  Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a
                  bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. This
                  staged process shall continue, consistent with the parameters
                  identified above, until all the claims included in these
                  coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or
                  otherwise resolved. The statute of limitations and any filing
                  fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this
                  staged process from the time the first cases are selected for
                  a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for
                  a bellwether process, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A
                  court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if
                  necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of
                  arbitration demands against GC or you.{" "}

            rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other
            jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
            other jurisdiction. If any Arbitrable Claim is not subject to
            arbitration pursuant to Section 14, then the state and federal
            courts located in Santa Clara, California will have exclusive
            jurisdiction. You and GC irrevocably waive any objection to venue in

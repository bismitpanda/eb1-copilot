Navigating the landscape of US immigration can often seem daunting, especially when dealing with various Green Card categories.

## üìä Acceptance Rates Breakdown:

- EB1A boasts an encouraging acceptance rate of approximately 70-75% as of 2023.
- EB1B (Outstanding Researcher) sees even higher rates at around 90%.
- EB1C, EB2, and EB3 often have near-guaranteed acceptance rates of about 95%.

## üìë Challenges Along the Way:

About 50% of applicants might face a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID). These are not always reflections on the merits of the application but often relate to specific legal nuances. For NOIDs, withdrawing and refiling can sometimes be more strategic, as changing the initial decision can be challenging. RFEs generally require submitting additional evidence to bolster your case.

## üîÑ What If You're Denied?

The good news is, denial isn't the end of the road. Applicants can reapply, providing an opportunity to address and rectify previous shortcomings in the application.

## üîç Reflection

The high approval rates, especially for EB1A, suggest that not all applicants need to be supremely qualified to succeed. This contrasts sharply with more selective processes, such as college admissions. The data implies a degree of self-selection, where those who apply typically believe they have a strong case, similar to how more people complete marathons than half-marathons.

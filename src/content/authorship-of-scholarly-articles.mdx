Most applicants grapple with a fundamental question: "How many citations do I need for an EB1A petition?" The answer: "It depends". Citations are contextual; their weight hinges on your overall achievements, field, and the caliber of your peers. While PhD students often shine in publications, professionals in the tech industry might follow a different trajectory.

Here are examples of evidence you can prepare:

- Google Scholar profile
- ResearchGate profile
- Impact Factor for relevant publications
- Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) journal ranking
- Other articles citing your work
- Press coverage regarding your authorship
- Information on the geographical locations of people citing your articles
- Support letters from colleagues, researchers, and government officials, describing:
  a. How they used your papers in product creation, publication, or revenue generation
  b. Real-world applications of your work
  c. Why your article is of major significance
  d. How they benefit from your work and intend to continue using your contributions
- Widespread public commentary about your article
- Evidence of your work being implemented by others
- Downloads or usage statistics
- Transcripts of recorded media
- Circulation information
- Translations
- Prizes or awards received due to your published research
- Presentations at international conferences on your article
- Evidence of visitor traffic to your podcast
- Ranking lists
- Magazine
- Newspaper
- Book
  a. Title page
  b. Page with your information
  c. Table of contents
  d. Publication date
  e. At least the first page of chapters you wrote
- Listing showing your article or book as required reading for a course

Considerations:

- Include your Google Scholar profile to avoid triggering a Request for Evidence (RFE)
- Consider impact factors of journals ie. quality over quantity
- Citations from prestigious organizations (CDC, World Bank, DoD, Red Cross, etc.) add credibility
- Peer letters stating the importance of your papers and how they impact their work are helpful
- A declining publication rate may be seen as a lack of acclaim
- Articles written for peers have greater weight than articles published for the public
- Articles in journals with international circulation are helpful
- Self-published work, thesis papers, locally published papers, and articles outside your field may not qualify

Navigating the scholarship articles criterion for EB1A requires comprehensive documentation and strategic planning. Tailor your evidence to meet the stringent standards set by USCIS adjudicators.

There are two key types of evidence required to satisfy the membership criterion. First, evidence showcasing your membership in an association demanding outstanding achievement. Second, evidence addressing questions posed by USCIS adjudicators to validate the legitimacy of your memberships.

Evidence of Membership in an Association Demanding Outstanding Achievement

- Documentation of elite membership invitation
- Proof of the organization's prestige through media coverage or recognition
- Documentation of membership standards and criteria
- Membership card or screenshot
- Letter from the membership committee stating selection criteria
- Information on the reviewing panel's national or international recognition
- Listing of other notable members and their achievements
- Exclusive membership evidence
- Proof of membership from a national or international pool
- Exam or license used for membership determination
- By laws of the organization
- Evidence of organization structure and mission

Evidence to Address USCIS Adjudicator Questions

- Details on membership requirements, showcasing selection based on outstanding achievements
- Demonstration of high membership standards
- Qualifications of individuals granting membership
- Information on other members' qualifications
- Level of exclusivity of the membership
- Relevance of the membership to your area of expertise

Considerations

- Trade unions, provincial organizations, or memberships based on employment, level of education, years of experience, and test scores won't work for EB1A
- Some organizations have levels of membership and lower levels won't work for EB1A because they are not exclusive
- If you don't qualify for this criteria, one option is to use the evidence to show you're contributing to the field and providing original contributions

Navigating the membership criterion for EB1A requires comprehensive documentation and strategic planning. Tailor your evidence to meet the stringent standards set by USCIS adjudicators.
